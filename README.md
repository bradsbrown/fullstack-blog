# Multi-User Blog
Welcome to the multi-user blog! This is a framework for you to host your own blog site where anyone registered can post, like, and comment, to allow for great interaction within this community!

# Quickstart Guide
All you need to do to get this rolling is:
1. Log into your Google AppEngine account and create a new app instance on the site.
1. On your computer, with the AppEngine Launcher, add this folder, which contains everything you need to get the service up on AppEngine.
1. Make sure you edit the `app.yaml` file so that the "application" field is set to match the name of the app instance you created on AppEngine.
1. Run and test it on your computer, edit the css stylings in `loggedin_frame.html` until the site looks the way you want it to.
1. Deploy your app!

# Usage
A few things to note about using the site:
* Any user can post.
* Only the user that creates a post or comment can edit or delete it.
* A user can not like their own post.

Outside of that, it is a pretty standard self-explanatory blog site. Enjoy!
